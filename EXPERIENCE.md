# Vibe Coding Experience

## Tool Selection
I chose an AI-assisted IDE (Cursor) because it provides a context-aware coding experience directly inside the editor. This allowed me to focus more on intended functionality rather than syntax.

## Development Process
The AI tool was used throughout development to scaffold the project and iteratively improve the quiz logic and user interface. Prompts were used to generate components, manage state, and debug issues. Several iterations were needed to reach a stable version.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was managing state correctly across quiz questions and ensuring a smooth user flow. The AI assisted in identifying logical problems, while some manual fixes were applied.

## Reflection
Vibe coding significantly accelerated development and reduced friction. It changed my workflow by enabling a more conversational, intent-driven approach. I would use this tool again for rapid prototyping and learning.
